 Hello and welcome back to VRC 1000  And in this eclectic reading lesson we will do  1 Analysis of the Cat VRC  In fact we will do a reading comprehension  I think that you can expect this in terms of an idea  Which you can expect in VRC  We had one analysis in the beginning of reading comprehension  But what I will do here  We will go and study more and more hard  The point is that this is right  For us to get marks  And we have to understand the challenges of reading  We are on the path  Thick  We obviously don't know what kind of question is going to be about the cat  How is this possible?  But we can see in the past  We can learn from the past  And we can use it  That is exactly the same as the cat  And the cat will be the same  One coming time in VRC  The cat will be the same
